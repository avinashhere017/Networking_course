# Structure of Network

- In this section we will learn the models that are used in today's networking technology and their layers.


## OSI Model

- It stands for Open Systems Interconnection Modal.
- There are 7 layers in this model:

                - Application Layer
                - Presentation Layer
                - Session Layer
                - Transport Layer
                - Network Layer
                - Data Link Layer
                - Physical Layer


### Application Layer

- It is implemented in the application itself.
- This is the only layer the user directly interacts with.
- Some protocols used are HTTP, FTP, etc.
- The application layer will give data to next layer which is Presentation Layer.


### Presentation Layer

- This layer handles encryption, encoding, translation, etc of the data received by the application layer.
- This layer assumes that the next layer which is Session Layer will convert the data by itself for further processing.
- SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is used for encryption and encoding in this layer.


### Session Layer

- This layer focuses on setting up the connection and managing it and then enabling processing of data followed by termination of the connected sessions.
- This layer assumes that the next layer which is transport layer will send the data once the connection is established.
