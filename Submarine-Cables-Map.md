## What are Submarine Cables?

- The wires which are spread deep down into the ocean are known as Submarine Cables.
- These wires are used to connect all countries to each other.
- These are physical and very thick wires laying deep into the ocean.
- Here wires are used because they are the fastest medium through which the data can be passed.
