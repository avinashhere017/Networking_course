## NAT

- NAT is known as Network Address Translation.
- It enables one unique IP Address to represent an entire group of computers, and saving IP Addresses.
- In network address translation, a network device, often a router or NAT firewall, assigns a computer or computers inside a private network a public address. In this way, network address translation allows the single device to act as an intermediary or agent between the local, private network and the public network that is the internet. NATâ€™s main purpose is to conserve the number of public IP addresses in use, for both security and economic goals.
- NAT modifies the packet's header by adding the correct IP Address.
